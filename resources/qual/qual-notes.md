# Qualitative Research Approaches in CS

## Learning Objectives

* Learn about the scope of qualitative research in CS
* Summarize different qualitative research methods
* See some exemplars of excellent qualitative CS papers

## Notes

I don't particularly like the qual/quant distinction - I find it more useful to look at research strategies using the ABC or WWH or Circumplex frameworks. 

But typically qualitative research refers to research strategies that analyze the evidence *qualitatively*, i.e., interpretively. Data sources that fit well in these strategies are personal narratives, observations of users, interview transcripts, texts like books or videos, open-ended survey answers, etc. 

Qualitative research is more often associated with constructivist and interpretivist philosophies. 

Good qualitative research is **no less valid** than quantitative research.

### Methods (established)

* ethnography/participant observation
* contextual inquiry
* interviews
* surveys (both qual/quant)
* 

### Methods (emerging/lesser known in CS)

* Narrative analysis

### Analysis Approaches

* [grounded theory](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2884781.2884833) 
* Thematic coding
* 

### Validity and qualitative research

A common critique of these methods is "the plural of anecdote is not data". As Yin's diagram shows, though, qualitative research is rarely just anecdote (and we can of course learn from anecdote! Aesop's fables are one example). However, a good question to ask when reading such work is "how do I know this is a true account and legitimate interpretation" of the data?
