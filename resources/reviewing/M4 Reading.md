# M4 - Reading Scientific Papers

## Learning Objectives

* Develop knowledge of topic formulation
* Efficiently read a paper
* Characteristics of literature reviews and mapping studies
* Plan a research study with visual abstracts
* Document research plans and turn that into a proposal

## Notes

### Choosing a Topic

Generally, being engaged and interested is important. It is very difficult to motivate your work if you aren't excited about the topic! Having said that, working with Professor X does imply that you work on topics that Professor X enjoys (e.g., mind control).

My other advice is to aggressively scope your work. It is easy to start out with "make a fully automated car", which isn't well scoped. You probably end up with something more like "LIDAR-based range finding in Volvo SUVs under uneven lighting conditions" or something. That isn't to say you should not have a big goal in mind - you should. But be aware that your results likely won't solve the problem - not immediately anyway. Another rule of thumb is that for a UVic Masters, expect to submit one A*/A conference paper, and for a PhD, 4-5 such papers. VERY rough guideline!

To do this, I recommend reading theses of fellow students in your lab. You will be surprised at how little work got in to the thesis. Of course, none of the false starts appear, or boring results, so it can be misleading.

**Easy Option 1**

* Your advisor tells you what to do.
* Pro: clear directive
* Con: maybe you don't want to do that!

**Slightly Less Easy Option 2**

* Find an old paper of your advisor/someone in their area.
* Look for future work sections or limitations
* Fix or improve on that.
* Pro: clearly a defined problem.
* Con: maybe it is future work because it is really hard!

**Hard Option 3**

* Find ongoing work in a conference. E.g., flip through DBLP proceedings in your area.
* Pick a hard problem that is tractable to solve in 1-4 years.
  * Open, Doable, Interesting
* Con: if it was easy to figure out the triplet above, everyone would do that.

**Easy Option 4**

* Talk to industry or people with problems
* Solve their problem
* Pro: leads nicely to jobs.
* Pro: obviously relevant 
* Con: industry problems often not important to research. Harder to publish.
