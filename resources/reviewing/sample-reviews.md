# Example Reviews

## The Good (save these!)
> Thanks for submitting your revision to EMSE. As I noted in my earlier recommendation, I took the liberty to check your responses to the remaining minor comments myself, without initiating another review round. I am satisfied with your revision and happy to recommend the acceptance of your manuscript to EiCs. Congrats!

> Normally, my reviews are much longer than this. For this paper, however, I do not have a lot more to add. The paper was well-written and well-structured, has a clear objective and methodology and is well-motivated. I could not find any typos either. I must admit that I am not an expert in the statistics and probabilistic programming presented in the paper, but nevertheless the paper remained fairly easy to read.

## The Helpful
> The reviewers all believe the topic is interesting. They also appreciate the large scale study and that a replication package is included, but there are some major concerns:
> - missing actionable recommendations/insights
> - unclear contributions over previous studies
> - topics identified are broad and not all related to design
> - bias in evaluation
> For these reasons, the reviewers agree that the manuscript is not ready for publication. We hope that the detailed reviews will be helpful in revising the study.

> Another conclusions is that we can tune LDA to produce results similar to the ones achieved with manual labelling. However, it seems this happened because the authors use results from the manual phase as input to the tuning process. For example, the authors mention that:

----
> To improve the paper I would suggest to a) introduce a section where the overall method is described without mentioning the realization (and the restrictions introduced by a particular realization)
>b) Based on this section, discuss different realization approaches
c) Relate you work to the work in graph-transformation etc.
d) Provide a concrete example which illustrates the advantages of your
approach

> 1. Line 118: "A less resource intensive reconstruction algorithm will allow researchers to keep up with the massive influx of new EOdata. It will also lower the cost of entry with regards to time and hardware for anyone who wishes to process this data in the future."

>This is an application only for researchers studying reconstruction algorithms as data providers already make L4 reconstructed products. Researchers studying the underlying process can often simply use the already made L4 products.

## The Ugly
> I have found this report very enjoyable to read: it does not pretend that anything can be widely generalised from one case study, but provides a careful and clear description of this specific software-engineering engagement, with enough detail to be interesting and sufficiently high level description to remain understandable even outside the specific SKAO community.

>My first main concern with the paper is its relevance to this ICSE track. I am not sure if the paper presents really novel findings for Practitioners and/or industry. It is more adequate for the scientific/research community who are also experts in design/SE rather than industry practitioners.My second concern is the level of difficulty to understand the paper probably because it was prepared in rush. For instance, Figure 2 is not part of the paper and has many other formatting issues. I did not really understand well the motivations behind the proposed SKAO to address practical problems related to scientific software.
