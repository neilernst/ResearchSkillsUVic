# M3 - Writing Scientific Papers

## Learning Objectives

* Learn some common guidelines for scientific (English-language) writing
* Plan a research study with visual abstracts
* Document research plans and turn that into a proposal

## Slides

* Table stakes for writing in English are good grammar and spell-checking. Lots of papers get accepted with typos and grammatical errors, but why annoy the reviewer? The Uvic Writing Center can be helpful. 

  * I cannot recommend enough that you can only improve writing in two ways:

    * Write more. Writing is also research! It generates ideas, clarifies connections, surfaces problems. While we joke about reviewer 2, ![Reviewer-2-Kanye](https://i2.wp.com/www.drmalviniredden.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Reviewer-2-Kanye.jpg)

      The reality is I have gotten far more useful, well-informed, and honest reviews in my career than the opposite (although I am a white male). Take the reviews to heart (your advisor should help you sort out which ones to pay attention to) and then rewrite the paper! Many papers (most?) do not get in on the first try. Look at this story from Laurence Tratt.

    * Read more. Read novels, pop non-fiction like Gladwell, and of course research papers (esp the ones that win awards). 

* Paper engineering can take a long time. Look at this [video of a paper evolving](https://twitter.com/martin_chap_man/status/1339940610699096064). Paper engineering refers to the little stuff: finding a good title (see below), cramming stuff into the 10 pages with `\vspace`, writing and rewriting the introduction. Leave more than 24 hours before the deadline to polish the paper! 

* In general a reviewer is time-constrained and wants to immediately know "what is this paper doing, and will it be worth my time". Make the answer OBVIOUS and YES. 

* The structure of your paper should follow your area conventions. In my case:

  * **Title**: Many approaches to title writing, I prefer something memorable and descriptive. Do not over claim, but do not be boring. This is often domain specific. Christian KÃ¤stner has a [nice summary for my domain](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ckaestne/ontitles/)). Apart from that expect to go over 4-5 versions. 
  * **Abstract**: I like [Steve Easterbrook's format](https://www.easterbrook.ca/steve/2010/01/how-to-write-a-scientific-abstract-in-six-easy-steps/). Remember that the abstract is often all that appears on the closed-access publishing world we have.
  * **Introduction**: motivates the problem, outlines the research approach, explains the contribution (don't keep people guessing - if you prove P=NP say so!)
  * **Background** and Related Work: where does this paper fit in the context of other work (there is ALWAYS other work)![PHD Comics on Twitter: "Optimal References. http://t.co/6EwRCbPlDp **Hey,  #ThePHDMovie2 screenings: http://t.co/swi4hojuH2 http://t.co/uOFHTxLsx8"](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CPGMFlNWwAAVPHO.jpg)
  * **Methods**: the details. Describe it so someone else can redo the approach.
  * **Results**: What was learned.
  * **Discussion**: implications of the results, tied back into the related work. Should in empirical domains mention limitations of the approach and threats to validity. 
  * **Conclusion**: My preference is to keep this very short and to the point, highlighting (perhaps) related work.

* I like the Schimel approach (see cheatsheet). 

  * Science writing is about telling a story. Make it an interesting one! 

  * Schimel uses the **SUCCES** mnemonic. Let's walk through these.

  * *S:* Simple = the core essence
     *U:* Unexpected = the unknown, a gap *C:* Concrete = data vs. abstract ideas *C:* Credible = ground ideas in lit.
     *E:* Emotional = engage curiosity
     *S:* Stories = integrated smaller units

    *Your job is to find what is novel and highlight the unexpected elements.*

- *Peer writing exercise*: in the breakout room, pick one person's elevator pitch, and then either a) turn that elevator pitch into a paper abstract using Easterbrook's template or b) pick out Schimel's SUCCES elements. Then report back to the class.
