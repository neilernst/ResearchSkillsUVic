# M3 - Writing Scientific Papers

## Learning Objectives

* Learn some common guidelines for scientific (English-language) writing
* Develop knowledge of topic formulation
* Plan a research study
* Document research plans and turn that into a proposal

## Slides

* Table stakes for writing in English are good grammar and spell-checking. Lots of papers get accepted with typos and grammatical errors, but why annoy the reviewer? 
* Paper engineering can take a long time. 
* I like the Schimel approach (see cheatsheet). 

- peer writing exercise: take the attached writing prompt and with a partner, improve the text for 5 minutes
  - Find a paper you have read recently. Suggest improvements
