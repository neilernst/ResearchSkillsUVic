# Ethical Issues in CS Research

## Learning Objectives

* Appreciate the need to develop an ethical framework for your research
* Learn about ethical implications of technology
* Acquire the TriCouncil certificate in human subjects research

## Notes

- Difference between ethics of human subjects research, and ethics of the research goals itself (the latter is usually not reviewed for academic freedom reasons, but has public opinion review), and ethical conduct in research (plagiarism, fake data, self citation, review circles).
- Ethics is rarely black and white. We have to balance competing priorities and it may not seem unethical until later.
- Exercise: speculate!
  - Get into small groups of 3. I will pick a leader, and the three of you will take the leader's research area, and explore possible ethical implicationsâ€”social media privacy, algorithmic bias, online harassment, intellectual property, misinformation. Where could technology or a social system go next that would be worthy of a *Black Mirror* episode? What might be the Light Mirror equivalent?
