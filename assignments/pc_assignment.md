# Program Committee Assignment

## Due:

- Enter your 2 reviews by **Nov 20**. 
- Upload an Arxiv paper to HotCRP by **Oct 5.**

## Overview

We will conduct a mini PC review and discussion using the 595 HotCRP instance - login instructions have been sent separately. 

## Required:

- Find  an *unpublished* and non-peer reviewed paper in your area (Arxiv/BioArxiv/... is the best place to find them). Read that paper.
- Upload the paper from Arxiv to the HotCRP site. DO NOT ENTER AUTHOR INFORMATION! Use your own email and a blank affil.
- In the abstract section please do NOT copy and paste the abstract: summarize instead the paper and point me to some of the relevant expertise needed (e.g., diagonalization, abstract interpretation, controlled experiments, software safety). This helps me to distribute it accurately.
- After the first deadline I will ask you to bid on papers to review.
- I will then assign reviews to you on that paper, along with 1-2 classmates. You will also have one other paper that is less related to review (very realistic in PC meetings!)
- Enter reviews for each paper before Nov 20. We will then have an asynchronous discussion for the papers we might accept. 
- Conclude the discussion with a recommendation for the PC chair.
