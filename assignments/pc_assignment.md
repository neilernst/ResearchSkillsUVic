# Program Committee Assignment

## Due:

- Deadline 1: Upload an Arxiv paper to HotCRP by **Week 4.**
- Deadline 1b: Submit your bids on which papers to review in HotCRP by **Week 5**.
- Deadline 2: Enter your 2 reviews by **Week 8**. 
- Deadline 3: Add your review comments by **Week 11**.

All deadlines are Friday, with grace period until Sunday.

## Overview

We will conduct a mini PC review and discussion using the 595 HotCRP instance - login instructions have been sent separately. 

## Required:

- Find  an *unpublished* and non-peer reviewed paper in your area (Arxiv/BioArxiv/... is the best place to find them). Read that paper.
  - the paper should be at least 10 pages, and research focused, i.e., not a literature review or magazine opinion piece. 
- Upload the paper from Arxiv to the HotCRP site (**deadline 1**). DO NOT ENTER AUTHOR INFORMATION! Use your own email and a blank affil.
- In the abstract section please do NOT copy and paste the abstract: summarize instead the paper and point me to some of the relevant expertise needed (e.g., diagonalization, abstract interpretation, controlled experiments, software safety). This helps me to distribute it accurately.
- After the first deadline I will ask you to bid on papers to review (**deadline 1b**).
- I will then assign reviews to you, along with 2 classmates. I cannot guarantee your paper will be one of them, based on numbers (2 reviews means we can only cover 2/3rds of the papers).
- You will have at least one other paper that is less related to review (very realistic in PC meetings!)
- Enter reviews for each paper (**deadline 2**).
    - Your review should be at least 500 words in total, and follow the template in the HotCRP form.
    - Remember you are providing feedback to the editor/PC chair, so specific, actionable remarks are needed.
    - Avoid generalities like "the authors did not comment on related work", and do not spend 300 words summarizing the paper.
    - A good review will take AT LEAST 1-2 hours of reading, and 1-2 hours of writing.
    - Subpar reviews will result in a mark of "fail" and you will have to fix your review before you can pass this assignment (and thus, the course).
-  We will then have an asynchronous discussion (i.e., you + the other 2 reviewers) for the papers we might accept (**deadline 3**).
    - enter a comment on each other review (i.e., 2 comments), responding to their concerns, and pointing out (gently!) how the review might be improved.
- Conclude the discussion with a recommendation for the PC chair.
