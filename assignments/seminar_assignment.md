**RESEARCH SEMINAR ASSIGNMENT**

**Critique of research seminars**

 

# Research Talk Assignment

## Due:  

* Apr 2, 2021

## Overview

This assignment consists in attending 2 seminars and writing a one paragraph critique for each of the seminars. The seminars should be at least 1 hr long including questions. Then write a short paragraph on each talk.

## Required

Choose one seminar close to your area of interest, and one that is in an unrelated area of research. For **each** of the seminars, write 1 paragraph that answers the following questions: 

1. What was the research about? 

2. What was the overall research question(s), goal(s) or hypotheses? 

3. What was the overall research method(s) employed in the research? 

4. What are the overall contributions of the work presented? 

5. Is the information pertaining to #1-4 above clearly presented? What improvements might you suggest?

 ### Possible venues

In hindsight offering to pay for registration was a good idea when I thought this would be 10 students, less good when it is 30. If you have a solid lead on a conference let's talk, but there are many free and accessible talks now on Zoom:

- https://cscan-infocan.ca/podium/ has different webinars
- https://www.cs.cmu.edu/scs-seminar-series
- https://web.cs.toronto.edu/news-events/events/distinguished-lecture-series-202021-

Pre-recorded seminars (e.g. a Youtube video from 2014) are not allowed.
