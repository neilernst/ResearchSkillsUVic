# Research Proposal Assignment

## Due:

- **Apr 8** - email me a PDF formatted in your venue's style of choice (e.g., IEEETran, ACM CompSci, CHI, NeurIPS, etc.)

## Overview

Prepare a 3 page proposal that captures the research you are doing, or plan to do. For a MSc. student, this will look like a thesis outline. For a PhD student, it will be the outline for your proposal phase. A more fleshed out version of this would be suitable for most cases as a pre-registration. 

## Required:

- Describe your technological rule
- Situate your research in the design science / visual abstract OR make an argument for why it does not fit. 
- Summarize the related work with at least 5 relevant publications, and where your work fits.
- Capture at least 2 research questions your research will answer.
- Describe the research strategies you will use to answer those questions. 
- Thus the following sections are required:
  - Title
  - Abstract
  - Overview/Intro
  - Background and Related Work
  - Research Questions
  - Research Strategy
  - Research Methods
  - Expected Results / Results so far
  - Bibliography (use bibtex)
