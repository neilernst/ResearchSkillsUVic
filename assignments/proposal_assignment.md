# Research Proposal Assignment

## Due:

- see Brightspace for submission deadlines.

## Overview

Prepare a 3 page proposal that captures the research you are doing, or plan to do. For a MSc. student, this will look like a thesis outline. For a PhD student, it will be the outline for your proposal phase. A more fleshed out version of this would be suitable for most cases as a pre-registration. 


## Required:

- Format the paper in your venue's style of choice (e.g., IEEETran, ACM CompSci, CHI, NeurIPS, etc.) If you go to Overleaf, there are pre-existing templates for this.
- make sure to prepare this as a professional research paper: use citations where needed, use technical writing standards, and follow the tips we cover in the course.
- Describe your *anticipated* technological rule (see the slide template below). A technological rule is in the form "To obtain <Effect/Result>, use <Solution/Intervention/Treatment> in this <Scenario/Context>".
- Situate your research in the [design science / visual abstract](https://github.com/margaretstorey/VASE/blob/master/Template.png), [McElreath's template](https://github.com/rmcelreath/PhD_planning_template/blob/master/PhD_template.pdf), OR make an argument for why it does not fit. 
- Summarize the related work with 3-5 relevant publications, and where your work fits.
- Capture at least 2 research questions or open problems your research will answer.
- Describe the research strategies you will use to answer those questions. 
- Thus the following sections are required:
  - Title
  - Abstract
  - Overview/Intro
  - Background and Related Work
  - Research Questions
  - Research Strategy
  - Research Methods
  - Expected Results / Results so far
  - Bibliography (use bibtex or related citation manager)
